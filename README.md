# Noita Acceleratium Starts Only

This mod forces the game seed to be one that starts you with an Acceleratium flask.
It will search for true acceleratium starts only, instead of simply changing the flask.
This means the starts will be valid "vanilla" starts and therefore suitable for speedrunning.
