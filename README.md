# Noita Acceleratium Starts Only
## TEST CODE
The 'test-seed-list' branch will generate a file containing all acceleratium start seed numbers.
This test will run at the start of a run: The game will appear to hang and you will almost certainly get the  "Well, this is embarrassing" screen.
Do not panic! the process is still running in the background. When it is done, the game will finish loading and start the run as normal (on seed 2147483647)

The output will appear in the mod folder ("mods/accel-seeds-only/test-seed-list")
